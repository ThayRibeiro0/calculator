Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that comes with npm, the Node Package Manager, which you'll use to install and manage packages for your project.

_How can I Download Node.js?_
Visit the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org/.

_Choose the LTS version:_
It's recommended to download the LTS (Long Term Support) version, as it provides stability and support for a longer duration. Look for the LTS version and click on the "Download" button.

_Select your operating system:_
Node.js supports multiple operating systems. Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

_Run the installer:_
Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the installation instructions provided by the installer.

_Verify the installation:_
After the installation is complete, you can verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing the following commands:
**bash**
**Copy code**
**node --version**
**npm --version**

_Optional: Configure npm proxy (if you're behind a proxy):_

**bash**
**Copy code**
**npm config set proxy http://proxy.example.com:port**

*Replace http://proxy.example.com:port with your actual proxy address and port.*
